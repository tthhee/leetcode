When love beckons to you follow him
though his ways are 
hard and steep And when 
his wings enfold you 
yield to him though the sword 
hidden among his 
pinions may wound you
And when he speaks to you 
believe in him 
though his voice
may shatter your dreams as 
the north wind lays
waste the garden.
